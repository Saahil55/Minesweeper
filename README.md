# Minesweeper

 
### Introduction
 This is my java implementation of Minesweeper. The source code files are: Board.java, BoardSquareButton.java and Psyss9Main.java.
 You can use my source code to play Minesweeper or edit for your own project. The parameters of the game can also be modified in the source code e.g. how large the game board is, how many mines there are etc. 
 
### Game Instructions
 The game has a grid of buttons, which represent  potential locations for mines. Initially all of the buttons are
blank so you don’t know whether they are mines or not. The aim of the game is to click on all of the non-mine buttons.
If you click on a mine then you lose. If you click on a non-mine then the square turns green and
tells you how many mines are immediately surrounding it –including diagonally.
If you find a square with no mines around it then the game will automatically explore the
surrounding (non-mine) squares for you, as if you have clicked on them.
You can right click on buttons to mark/remember potential mines (the button will turn red).
If you find all of the non-mine squares then you win.
